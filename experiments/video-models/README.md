# Video planner model experiment (2026-09-25)

Can GPT-6 write and design explainer videos as well as Claude? Each repository
was read once; the same input then went to five director/designer setups. Every
film was voiced by the same ElevenLabs voice (the narrator at the time) and
rendered by the same engine. Narration now uses Gemini 3.8 Flash through
OpenRouter (`src/server/explainer/voice.ts`), so these scripts are a historical
record: they are not type-checked or linted with the app and may not run
against the current code.

- `run.ts generate | render | summary`: make the films (run with
  `bun --conditions=react-server`; rendering needs `serve.ts` running and
  `VIDEO_RENDER_CHROME_PATH`).
- `sheets.py`: one frame per beat, tiled per film.
- `judge.ts`: blind scoring by Claude Opus 5.5 and GPT-6 Sol from the script and
  contact sheet, films labelled by letter only.
- Output (videos, reports, `index.html` side by side) lands in `out/`.

Swap models in the app with `VIDEO_PLANNER_MODEL` (any `gpt-*` model uses the
OpenAI Responses API) and `VIDEO_PLANNER_EFFORT` (`low` by default).

## Results: fastapi, ripgrep, zustand, excalidraw

| GPT-6 Luna, medium                | $0.02       | 64–93 s     | 16                       | 6.0, 4.0                        | 6.8, 3.75                    |

- Opus writes the best narration: a real hook, one story, lines that land.
  Its 23 warnings are all on ripgrep: it made up a messy file tree for the
  opening, the validator dropped those paths, and the panel showed up empty.
- Sol (medium most of all) is accurate and tidy but flatter: more abstract,
  clause-heavy, less of a story. The GPT judge ranked it first on ripgrep and
  excalidraw; the Claude judge ranked Opus first on all four.
- Luna is clearly weaker: made-up paths (`src/main.rs` in ripgrep), crowded
  and overlapping layouts, too few beats, and one script that stayed too long
  after the trim (168 words).
